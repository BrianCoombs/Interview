# My Personal Interview Prep

* I used this folder, and the material in it, to help me do well in and pass varios technical interviews
* The problems in the problems folder contain code to solve various types of problems from LeetCode
    * there are over 70 solved problems in the folder
    * each file might contain more than one problem solution
    * each file is commented to some extent, and some problems are commented more than others, however I understand some things might be ambigious
    * if you have an issue with a question or need further explanation simply create an issue in this repo
    * not every single file in this folder will be able to compile and run
    * some problems require the use of other structures that have not been implemented, however the logic to solve the problem is the same and has been tested to work
    * chances are if the file has a main method then it will compile and run
* The notes folder contains a Technical Interview Markdown Cheatsheet (not my work) as well as other notes I took on problems and techniques I found interesting
* There is also an Algorithms PDF in the notes folder that is very helpful for algorithm practice and theory
    * it used at Georgia Tech in the Undergrad and Grad Algorithms classes (CS 3510)
    * it goes over Number Theory, Divide and Conquer, Graph, Dynamic Programming, and P/NP
